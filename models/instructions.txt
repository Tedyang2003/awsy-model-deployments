MODELS
---------------------------
Here you should see the folders of 4 models

- deep seek 6b base
- all minilm l6 v2
- meta llama 3 8b instruct awq
- seallms v3 7b chat

Please ensure that the model name inside of configpbtxt matches that of the trained model resource (if used).
Ensure that the folder path for the models with model.json with also point to a directory with the same model name.

I have only loaded the 3 new model weigth repo files onto babasaur, llama is not included. 

* For the ensemble model all-minilm-l6-v2, its  model.onnx is together with its pbtxt in a sub folder named model. 
Its tokenizer files are inside wth the sub folder called tokenizer
